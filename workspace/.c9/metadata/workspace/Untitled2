The spaces are removed from the english text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle).  For example, the sentence \"If man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots\" is 54 characters long, so it is written into a rectangle with 7 rows and 8 columns. "," ","                ifmanwas","                meanttos        ","                tayonthe","                groundgo","                dwouldha","                vegivenu","                sroots","                ","The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.   For example, the message above is coded as:"," ","imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau"," ","#################","# The Code"," ","You've been given a starter template to work with."," ","#####","## square.c"," ","This is where the majority of your code will go. You may introduce new functions, but you may not change the names of anything there, because this will break the test suite."," ","#####","## square_test.c "," ","This file contains the test suite that will be run against your code. "," ","To run it, type"," ","make test"," ","on the command line, and then execute the program square_test as follows:"," ","./square_test"," ","This will tell you if your C code is correct according to the tests your Evil Professor has provided you."," ","#####","## square.h"," ","If you add any new functions to square.c, you will need to add headers for them here as well. I don't expect you to need to add new functions for this assignment, however."," ","#####","## Makefile"," ","This is a good thing to look at; it takes care of defining how your programs should be compileted.
